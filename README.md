# Body Mass Means

Body Mass Data:
Body mass data were collated from a number of pre-existing databases and scientific literature (see "References" tab, below). Where minimum and maximum values 
were given, maximum was taken to ensure measures were most likely those of mature individuals, and thus in line with commonly reported measures from the other 
databases. The majority of data sources did not contain sex-specific body size measurements; however, where sex was indicated an average of the male / female 
record was taken to account for dimorphism. Finally, where multiple records of the same species were present between datasets, the average was taken, with all 
records then standardised to reflect a common unit (grams).

Body Mass Estimations
To enable the comparison of taxa with no available body mass data in literature, estimates were calculated using clade and measurement‐specific allometric 
regression equations, where possible (Feldman & Meiri, 2013; Feldman, et al., 2016; Santini et al., 2018, Stark et al., 2020). These were configured W = a Lb, 
where W = body mass, L = length and priors a and b are the intercept and slope of a regression line over log‐transformed weight‐at‐length data, respectively 
(see Froese et al., 2013; Ripple et al., 2017).
This method was applied to 47 amphibian species using snout to vent length (SVL) records and clade-specific priors (Santini et al., 2018; Stark et al., 2020), 
and a further 320 fish species’ mass were estimated, based on maximum total length (TL) and regression priors, as listed on FishBase (Froese et al., 2013). 
Where a measure other than TL was listed (e.g. standard length (SL), fork length (FL)), regression coefficients were used to convert these to TL before estimating 
body mass.
